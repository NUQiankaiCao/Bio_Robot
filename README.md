# Bio-inspired CPG and Neuromorphic Computing Circuits for Quadruped Control

This repository provides the open-source implementation associated with the paper:

**"Modeling, Design and In-situ Demonstration of Bio-inspired Central Pattern Generator and Neuromorphic Computing Circuits for Complex Kinematic Control of Quadruped Robots"**

Presented at **GLSVLSI 2025 (Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI)**.

## 📄 Project Overview

This work introduces a hardware-software co-design framework for real-time locomotion control of quadruped robots, inspired by biological central pattern generators (CPGs). The project demonstrates:

- Design and simulation of mixed-signal neuromorphic CPG circuits
- Integration with low-power SoC and actuator drivers
- In-situ experimental results on a physical quadruped platform
- Robust performance across various gaits and terrain conditions

## 🧠 Key Features

- Central Pattern Generator (CPG) modeling and hardware implementation
- Neuromorphic computing circuits for gait generation and adaptation
- Real-time robot control system with custom firmware
- In-situ demonstration with video and hardware validation
